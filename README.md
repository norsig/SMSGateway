# SMS Gateway

SMS Gateway to verify accounts through phone numbers.

## How it works?

Define url where we listen for new sms

    private final static String URL_LISTENER = "ws://server-ip:8888/foo/bar";

JSON format:

    {
      "phone_number": "+549123456789",
      "verification_code": "ASD123",
      "message": "test message"
    }
